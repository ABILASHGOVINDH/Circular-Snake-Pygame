🍎 Random Food Generation: The food appears randomly, and the snake grows upon eating it.
🎮 Real-time Movement Control: Control the snake using arrow keys for movement.
🏆 Score Tracking: Your score increases each time the snake eats the food.
💥 Game Over Detection: The game ends when the snake collides with itself, displaying a "Game Over" message.


How to Play:
    Use the arrow keys to move the snake in any direction:
    
        UP Arrow   : Move the snake up.
        DOWN Arrow : Move the snake down.
        LEFT Arrow : Move the snake left.
        RIGHT Arrow: Move the snake right.
        Eat the food to grow the snake and increase your score.
